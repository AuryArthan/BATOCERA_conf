		<desc>Metroid Fusion is a 2002 Game Boy Advance side-scrolling metroidvania platformer video game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and released by Nintendo of America in the USA on November 18, 2002.

Samus Aran returns in an all-new Metroid adventure!

While lending mission support on planet SR388, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite, an organism with the ability to mimic the abilities of any creature it infects. Near death, Samus is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA of the last Metroid -- the X parasite's only natural predator. When the X spread to a research station in orbit around SR388, a weakened Samus is forced to exterminate them all ... or die trying.

The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.</desc>

		<desc>Pokémon Clover is a ROM Hack of Pokémon Fire Red featuring the two brand new regions of Fochun and the Ebin Isles, as well as 386 original fakemon!

Started in late 2014 as a janky rehash of Pokémon Fire Red, Pokémon Clover has since evolved into a complete overhaul with all-new characters, story, maps, music and gameplay mechanics.

The main point of Clover is to be both a parody of 4chan’s imageboard culture as well as a parody of Pokémon as a whole. It thus contains themes and language not suited for the faint of heart.

The current version of Clover has been in the works for over 4 whole years with effort worth thousands of hours by over 40 contributors, and with an estimated play time of over 100 hours, Clover is sure to bring you moments filled with joy, frustration, laughter and suffering!

So what are you waiting for? Take on a journey as Professor Stump’s Pokédex aide and battle tough rivals and Gym Leaders as you travel through fields, oceans, deserts and mountains!</desc>

		<desc>Welcome to Borrius, a region rich with history. Centuries ago, the Borrian people were enveloped in a great war with a foreign land. When all seemed lost, the Borrian king summoned a powerful force to help turn the tide of battle. Unfortunately, the war ended in defeat when the king of the foreign land unleashed a devastating weapon. Disgruntled, the Borrian army returned home.

The people, now enraged against the Borrian king, attempted a coup by manipulating the dark force summoned during the war. The Borrian king was able to seal away its power, however, and the coup was thwarted.

Many years later, an organization known simply as the "Shadows" seems bent on releasing the dark force once again. Are they after the destruction of the Borrius region, or is there something else at play? It's up to you to stand in their way!​</desc>

Wario's back for more...and more...and MORE!

Hey! You! Yeah, you! Listen up when Wario's talking to you! I just read about this legendary Pyramid of Gold, and you're gonna help me go explore it. There's lots of treasure in there for the taking, and I want it all. I'm sure there are gonna be all kinds of weird enemies and big, bad bosses in there, so if you don't think you can hack it, put the game down now. I don't want any losers making me jump into bottomless pits, you hear me?

-Wario invades the Game Boy Advance! See Wario in all his greedy glory as he explores vivid worlds made possible by the power of the GBA!
-Flex your muscles! Wario is no longer immortal, so you'll have your work cut out as you roll, punch and jump your way to tougher and tougher challenges. Wario will get stung by bees, zombified, bitten by bats, set on fire, and much more - what a way to make a living!
-Over twenty enormous stages await! Hunt down CDs for your listening pleasure, or collect treasure to spend on all-new items that you can use against the most bizarre bosses ever!</desc>
