Skye of Lynlora was just a restless shepherd when she first came across the strange item that would change her life forever. Now she has opened a portal to another place and chaos has come forth. Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the Boston Animation-developed M&M's: The Lost Formulas), this game features prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J.

Instead, opposing players must force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.",
