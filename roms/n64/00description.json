It was later re-released for the iQue Player in 2004, the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2015, and Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Switch Online in 2021.\n\nPaper Mario has the player taking control of Mario on his quest to rescue Princess Peach and save the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser, who has stolen the mythical Star Rod of Star Haven and used its wish-granting powers to make himself invincible. To stop Bowser and rescue Princess Peach, Mario and company must save the seven Star Spirits; magical beings who have been sealed in cards by Bowser with the power to nullify the Star Rod, as well as the original owners of the Star Rod.\n\nPaper Mario's gameplay is a blend of traditional Japanese role-playing games and Mario-esque platforming features; Mario has the ability to jump in both the overworld and in battle, and jumping remains one of the most important actions in the game. The player controls Mario and a party of followers as they journey through the Mushroom Kingdom, exploring dungeons, managing stats, and battling enemies. The title refers to the game's arts and crafts aesthetic; nearly every character in the game is drawn as a flat 2D sprite, revealing itself as paper-thin when turning around, and many elements of the environments are also depicted as 2D sprites.\n\nPaper Mario was initially in development for the Nintendo 64DD under the name Super Mario RPG 2[5] (also called Mario RPG 2[6] or Mario RPG 64[7]) and intended as a sequel to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Concept art posted by Super Mario RPG artist Kazuyuki Kurashima on his Instagram account in 2019 indicated that Samus Aran and Link from the Metroid and The Legend of Zelda franchises would have appeared alongside Mario characters.[8] It later became the first installment of the Paper Mario series and would go on to receive several sequels; the first in the same style of gameplay (Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door), followed by four in different playstyles (Super Paper Mario, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Paper Mario: Color Splash, and Paper Mario: The Origami King).\n\nThe above text is from the Super Mario Wiki and is available under a Creative Commons license.

It is a reboot of the original Star Fox, and the only game in the Star Fox series to be released on the Nintendo 64. An autostereoscopic remake, titled Star Fox 64 3D, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011.\n\nStar Fox 64 was the first Nintendo 64 game to have included support for the Rumble Pak, with which it initially came bundled. The game received critical acclaim for its smooth animation, detailed visuals, voice acting, and use of multiple gameplay paths.\n\nStar Fox 64 is set on a group of planets in the Lylat system. Ingenious scientist Andross, a native of the fourth planet Corneria, is driven to madness and nearly destroys the planet using biological weapons. For Andross' treason, General Pepper exiles the scientist to the remote planet Venom. Five years after Andross' exile, Pepper detects suspicious activity on Venom.[7] Pepper hires the Star Fox team (consisting of James McCloud, Peppy Hare, and Pigma Dengar) to investigate. When the three arrive at Venom, Pigma betrays the team, which causes James and Peppy to be captured by Andross. Peppy escapes and tells James' son, Fox McCloud, about his father's fate.\n\nA few years later, Andross launches an attack across the Lylat system. Realizing that his army cannot stop Andross, Pepper summons the Star Fox team, now consisting of Fox, Peppy, Falco Lombardi and Slippy Toad.[8] While traveling through several planets, including the Lylat system's star, Solar, and the asteroid field Meteo, the team battles with several of Andross' henchmen, including the rival mercenaries, Star Wolf.\n\nStory:\nAfter arriving in Venom, Fox defeats Andross, but discovers that it is actually a robotic version of himself and destroys it, leaving Andross drifting in the Lylat System. Fox decides to redeem himself by returning to Venom and defeat Star Wolf once again. When Fox defeats Andross once more, he reveals his true form, a floating brain with two floating eyes. After killing Andross, James appears to show Fox the way out, then vanishes immediately after. Escaping the lair's destruction, Star Fox returns to Corneria for a victory celebration, as the game's end credits roll.\n\nWhen offered membership into the Cornerian Army, Fox declines on behalf of his team; saying \"Oh no, sir. We prefer doing things our own way\". The game ends with the Great Fox and the Star Fox team flying off in their Arwings into the skies.",

He will not, however, be taught the extent of how this mechanic can affect the world around him. Using the shotgun not only annihilates enemies, but many of the objects and facets of the overworld/levels have had custom behaviour added in, so that shotgunning them often causes some bizarre effect. Here are a few examples of the many custom behaviours:\n- Doors can now be blown off their hinges.\n- Trees can sustain multiple forms of damage and will also be left singed.\n- Cannon hatches can be destroyed, thus giving the Bob-omb Buddies a permanent holiday.\n- Power Stars undergo a divorce upon being shot.\n- Lakitu skip has never been easier.\nThere are many, many others, but this hack is best experienced without knowing much of what will happen.",

Oblivion is a monstrous cosmic entity that consumed everything in its path. It reigned before the birth of our universe. Invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out, Oblivion fed on the very energy of the dead and dying. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate. Though totally ravaged, Oblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands (a strange and primitive world where \"time has no meaning\"), and the Lost Lands from countless others. The last shreds of the pure energy source that created our world and nearly wiped out Oblivion are contained within the Light Burden, the bag that every member of the Turok lineage has carried. The death of the Turok mantle will signal the beginning of the end: the rebirth of Oblivion.\n\n\u2022 Saves via Controller Pak",
