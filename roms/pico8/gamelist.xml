8 Legs to Love is separated into six levels of just over two minutes each. The goal of each level is to spin an elaborate web and use it to catch bugs. Each level poses a different challenge for building and maintaining a web, and introduces new and exotic types of bugs. Complete a playthrough and work towards a personal high score! Or just have good time, there's no pressure.</desc>

		<desc>Another little project my brother and I have been working on. We are huge Cave Story fans, so building a demake was kind of a childhood dream come true. Never ceases to amaze me how much can be done within the (wonderful self-imposed) limitations of the Pico-8 engine.

It has no real ending as-of-now, we might add that in later. But for now, enjoy! If you want to see some of our process in creating this, we vlogged about it at DoubtfulGames</desc>

		<desc>Sharing my first project for PICO-8 platform. This game is inspired by a classic 90s fighting game franchise. I aimed to port as many original elements from the source game as possible within the limitations imposed by PICO-8. Some elements were left out as I reached the maximum token limit, however, I am very satisfied with the results achieved.

I hope you enjoy the result and find at least a few moments of fun and nostalgia. I look forward to your comments!</desc>

		<desc>Play against AI or with up to 4 players.

Z to hit the ball. To hit the ball in different directions you need to hit it when it's off to your side. So the further to your right the ball is when you hit it the more it will go left.

X to do a power shot. Whenever you return the ball during a rally you will build up power. You can do a power shot anytime you have power in your meter, but the more it builds up the faster your shot will be.</desc>

		<desc>Why are you reading this, it's Tetris, you probably already know how it works

Anyways, this clone is guideline-compliant in large parts (except where the guideline is boring or confusing to me), including Standard Rotation System and kicks. It has a steep difficulty curve, and a lot of options to adjust gameplay, animations, or Tetromino sprites (I have 16 now!).

I implemented 9 different modes, and up to 3 highscores are automatically saved per mode (options are also automatically saved btw)</desc>

		<desc>Late last year (2017) I started work on a port of Super Mario Bros [NES] to Pico-8. The goal was to be authentic as possible to the original game, while working within the Pico-8 limitations. Something like Super Mario Bros Deluxe [GBC] (https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_Bros._Deluxe).

In the end I was able to get 1-1 and 1-2 mostly complete before starting to hit serious memory limits which make it seem near impossible to ship the full game.

With that in mind, I'm releasing it as-is for now so that people can check it out and see where it was headed.</desc>

		<desc>Welcome, Villager!
You are on this island to build a cosy little town for the peeple that want to live here.

Gather wood and stones to build and unlock other buildings. Some produce resources for you, others make your inhabitants happy. Well-fed and happy peeple produce more resources but keep them hungry or sad and they will leave. They might seem a bit lazy, but without them, buildings won't produce anything!

Build your first house and somebody will come soon, but there is no rush! Take your time and explore the island. There is no pressing matter, no harsh lose-condition, so be creative and build something beautiful.

Be good to them, and have fun.</desc>

This is my attempt at making a polished game in a week and a half, although it ended up being 2 weeks. I had to drop a few features I wanted to put in due to time, and code ended up getting a bit messy. Still, I'm pretty happy with how it came out.

The frame rate can drop sometimes, particularly in the later parts of the game when there are a lot of enemies around.</desc>
