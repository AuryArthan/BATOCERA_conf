		<desc>Atic Atac is an arcade-adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play The Game, released for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. The game takes place within a castle in which the player must seek out the three parts of the "Golden Key of ACG" through unlocking doors and avoiding enemies. The game is presented in a top-down perspective. They can choose from three different characters; a Wizard, Knight or Serf. Each character has access to a secret passage unique to them, meaning that navigating the castle is different for each one.</desc>
