While locked up, he finds a letter that puts him on the trail of finding the legendary (Amulet of Nine Lives) that will not only help him defeat his rival but promises near immortality. Claw escapes the dungeon and explores 14 levels that contain more than 40 enemies and bosses. 

The game features sprawling levels with numerous puzzles and features a multiplayer mode that supports up to 64 players at www.captainclaw.com. The Internet site includes a player forum, a high-scores listing, rankings, art, tips and codes, a treasure guide, and many Claw site links as well.</desc>

		<desc>Icy Tower is a freeware video game by Swedish game developer Free Lunch Design. It is a platform game set in a tower, where the player's goal is to jump from one 'floor' to the next and go as high as possible without falling and plunging off the screen. The higher the player's character climbs, the faster the tower's floors move downward and the harder the game becomes.</desc>

		<desc>A Slower Speed of Light is a first-person game prototype in which players navigate a 3D space while picking up orbs that reduce the speed of light in increments. Custom-built, open-source relativistic graphics code allows the speed of light in the game to approach the playerâ€™s own maximum walking speed. Visual effects of special relativity gradually become apparent to the player, increasing the challenge of gameplay. These effects, rendered in realtime to vertex accuracy, include the Doppler effect (red- and blue-shifting of visible light, and the shifting of infrared and ultraviolet light into the visible spectrum); the searchlight effect (increased brightness in the direction of travel); time dilation (differences in the perceived passage of time from the player and the outside world); Lorentz transformation (warping of space at near-light speeds); and the runtime effect (the ability to see objects as they were in the past, due to the travel time of light). Players can choose to share their mastery and experience of the game through Twitter. A Slower Speed of Light combines accessible gameplay and a fantasy setting with theoretical and computational physics research to deliver an engaging and pedagogically rich experience.</desc>
