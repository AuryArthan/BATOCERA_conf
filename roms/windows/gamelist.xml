		<desc>A Slower Speed of Light is a first-person game prototype in which players navigate a 3D space while picking up orbs that reduce the speed of light in increments. Custom-built, open-source relativistic graphics code allows the speed of light in the game to approach the playerâ€™s own maximum walking speed. Visual effects of special relativity gradually become apparent to the player, increasing the challenge of gameplay. These effects, rendered in realtime to vertex accuracy, include the Doppler effect (red- and blue-shifting of visible light, and the shifting of infrared and ultraviolet light into the visible spectrum); the searchlight effect (increased brightness in the direction of travel); time dilation (differences in the perceived passage of time from the player and the outside world); Lorentz transformation (warping of space at near-light speeds); and the runtime effect (the ability to see objects as they were in the past, due to the travel time of light). Players can choose to share their mastery and experience of the game through Twitter. A Slower Speed of Light combines accessible gameplay and a fantasy setting with theoretical and computational physics research to deliver an engaging and pedagogically rich experience.</desc>

		<desc>Icy Tower is a freeware video game by Swedish game developer Free Lunch Design. It is a platform game set in a tower, where the player's goal is to jump from one 'floor' to the next and go as high as possible without falling and plunging off the screen. The higher the player's character climbs, the faster the tower's floors move downward and the harder the game becomes.</desc>

		<desc>Macbat 64 is a low poly 3D Platformer and 4:3 loveletter to the late 90s.

All the 3D platforming goodness from the late 90s is back! Search, Collect and Jump (multiple times in a row even!) like it's 1998!

3D Platforming is not enough? Well, I got some kart racing, 8-Bit minigames, stunt driving 80s cars, First Person shooting sections, 2.5D Sections, a bar full of half drunk characters and a temple full of water for you! ...wait, come back here! The waterlevel is not that difficult, I promise!</desc>
