When pointers move, their orientation changes.\n\nPointers attack the square in front of them. Nobles cannot enter an attacked square, and when they are attacked they must move out. If they are attacked and cannot move, they are defeated.\n\nA player wins if their noble reaches the center of the board, or if all other players are defeated.\n\nPointers cannot enter the center and can only be moved once per turn.",
