		<desc>Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story is an action-adventure game featuring a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigasâ€™ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.</desc>
