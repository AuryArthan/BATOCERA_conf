		<desc>Join the hapless knight, Dirk the Daring, in his rigorous quest to rescue the lovely Princess Daphne. Dirk's unrelenting love for the Princess gives him the will and strength to journey through the cavernous castle of Mordroc, the evil wizard.

In order to rescue the Princess Daphne, Dirk the Daring must defeat several creatures conjured up by Mordroc, including his personal pet, Singe, the fire-breathing dragon. Our hero must also overcome a series of nefarious traps and black magic spells in his battle with Mordroc.

As you guide Dirk on this quest, each screen comes to life with smooth-running animated graphics taken directly from the original laser disk game. Never before have computer adventure players been able to experience animation like this. And never before has Dirk the Daring had you to guide and counsel him through this action packed game.</desc>
