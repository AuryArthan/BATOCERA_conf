		<desc>Clock Tower is a point and click survival horror game and the first installment in the Clock Tower series. It was developed and published by Human Entertainment for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), or Super Famicom in Japan, on September 14, 1995 in Japan.

Jennifer Simpson and her friends are from Granite Orphanage in Romsdalen, Norway. Adopted by a wealthy recluse named Mr. Barrows, they have come to live in the mansion known as "Clock Tower".

Though, this mansion is not what it seems. Strange experiments are taking place in the shadows, and horrific creatures prowl through the night. Jennifer's friends have gone missing, and now she must rescue them and  try to escape with their lives.

Clock Tower is a haunting adventure with over 10 different endings, and will stick with you long after you've stopped playing. Players beware.

The DELUXE patch adds mouse support as well as new content from the PlayStation port to the SNES original. There are also lots of improvements like bugfixes and the ability to run through stairs, speed up the credits along with faster health regeneration. Recent additions include a refined chase system coupled with new hiding places and weapons. Your save file is also now protected in case you accidentally choose "NEW GAME" at the main menu.</desc>

		<desc>F-Zero is a 1991 SNES racing video game developed by Nintendo EAD and released by Nintendo of America in the USA on August 23, 1991.

F-Zero is set in the year 2560, when humanity's multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth's social framework. This led to commercial, technological and cultural interchanges between planets. The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula One races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named "F-Zero" after a rise in popularity of the races. The game introduced the first set of F-Zero racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh.</desc>

		<desc>Lemmings was one of the most popular computer games of its time, and several gaming magazines gave it some of their highest review scores at the time.

The behavior of the creatures in Lemmings is based on the supposed behavior of real lemmings, who by urban legend are believed to go on migrations en masse that eventually lead to disaster. The basic objective of the game is to guide lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.</desc>

		<desc>Thousands of years ago, there was a war between the Gods of creation. Due to its effect on the mortal plane, the Gods were forced to punish themselves - to prevent such a thing from happening again. As such, they were all but cut off from the mortal world, with little to no influence, leading humanity to lose their faith.

However, one group survived the thousands of years that passed after the war - the Sanguis vampire family. Their goal across those millennia was to undo the binding that their patron deity, Niscura was under. They wanted the Goddess of Dimensions and Shadow to be free again...
...and they succeeded.

there's a bit of sensitive content here and there in the hack so do keep that in mind when playing</desc>

		<desc>BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets[5] was a game for the BS-X Broadcasting System add-on for the Super Famicom (the Japanese Super Nintendo). Games were downloaded from St. GIGA's satellite radio service. The game was much like a Second Quest or Master Quest of A Link to the Past, sharing a very similar overworld with slight changes and entirely new dungeons. Unlike a Second Quest however, it has an entirely new story. Various actions earned the player points, and these points could later be traded in to Nintendo for different prizes.

Ancient Stone Tablets is different from most other Zelda games as the game's central heroes are actually the avatars of the player's ID for the BS-X Broadcasting System, drawn into Hyrule, which is also true for BS The Legend of Zelda. The difference being that this time the player does not take the place of Link, but takes part in a new tale set after the events of A Link to the Past. The male character wears a green tunic (though others are later available) and a backwards baseball cap. The female character has long red hair and is otherwise almost exactly the same as the male.</desc>
