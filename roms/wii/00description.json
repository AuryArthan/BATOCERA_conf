The game provides a list of current goals for the player to complete to advance the game.

Wii is a 2009 Wii side-scrolling platformer video game developed by Nintendo EAD and released by Nintendo of America in the USA on November 15, 2009.\n\nRun and jump to your way to fun with Mario & friends!\n\nDevelopers at Nintendo have dreamed of creating a simultaneous multiplayer Super Mario Bros. game for decades. The Wii console finally makes that dream come true for everyone. Now players can navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time on the same level at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-paced Super Mario Bros. fun.\n\n- New Super Mario Bros. Wii offers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.\n\n- Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies, items and even balls of fire.\n\n- In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote\u2122 controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform \u2013 or might make it tilt incorrectly just to mess with other players.\n\n- New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote, and Mario\u2019s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.\n\n- At the end of each stage during the coin battle multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on the number of coins they have collected.",

The primary objective of the game is to acquire the 'Master Flesh' from each tower's master beast, as this is the only way to break the curse. Players only have a certain amount of time in the towers before Elena's curse worsens (displayed as a meter on the player's screen) and the player is forced to exit the tower in order to give Elena flesh; thus it is important for the player to take shortcuts in order to reach the top as well as to go back.",

Players experience dizzying perspective shifts as they run upside down through wild alien worlds that need to be seen to be believed.

Controlling Mario is as simple as can be with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Move Mario with the Control Stick and shake the Wii Remote to perform a spin move or cue Ring Stars that launch you to and from planetary objects. You can even point at bits of stardust to collect them or latch onto Beam Stars to blaze a magnetic trail through the heavens.\n\n* Mario can run, tiptoe, jump, triple-jump, backflip, and long-jump, but what he'll do most is spin. By shaking the Wii Remote, players make Mario spin around with fists outstretched, allowing him to pummel enemies and cue Star Rings that launch him from planet to planet.\n\n* He can also find plenty of power-ups: A Bee Mushroom turns him into Bee Mario, allowing him to fly for short periods of time and cling to honeycombs. A Boo Mushroom turns him into Boo Mario, allowing him to float and turn invisible to pass through mesh gates.\n\n* He'll constantly collect bits of stardust. These can be fired at enemies using the B Button. A second player can even take on this role, using a second Wii Remote to stall enemies, fire stardust, or even sweep aside projectiles.",

Every level is new, but the game retains the charm, sense of wonder and beauty in line with Mario's history. Mario works his way through the various levels, sometimes upside-down, sometimes floating from place to place.\n* On some stages, Mario can find an egg, smash it open and hop onto the back of Yoshi. Yoshi can use his tongue to grab items and shoot them back at enemies, or to snag attach points and swing across chasms.\n* Yoshi has an interesting diet. When he eats a Dash Pepper, he gets so hot and frenzied he can run up steep inclines and vertical walls. When he eats a Blimp Fruit, he inflates like a balloon and floats to new heights.\n* New power-ups include a drill that Mario uses to tunnel through the planet's surface all the way to the other side of a planet.\n* Skilled players will want to collect new Comet Metals, which will unlock harder levels with even more challenges.",

Exploring the vast world takes a significant part in the gameplay. Weather and day/night cycle influence the availability of quests and characters. In such an open world it is not uncommon to encounter creatures much stronger than what Shulk and his allies can manage. When the player dies he is teleported to the last save point with no penalty. Objectives can be completed in any order and many side quests are available. \n\nThe fighting system resembles the one from Final Fantasy XII. There is no \"battle screen\"; battles happen directly in the open field without transition. During the battle attacks are launched automatically at regular intervals. The player selects his actions via a menu. Aside from Shulk, the player can control a team of characters with various abilities. Team attacks are available to inflict extra damage. However, once the player enters a battle, characters cannot be switched, and all other allies are AI-controlled.\n\nAlso Available\nCollector's Edition",
