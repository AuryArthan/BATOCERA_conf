The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the color represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.",

The game also saw the introduction of the \"Crazy Hop\" feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they taxi passengers around the locations. By performing moves such as the \"Crazy Hop\" and the \"Crazy Dash\", the driver accumulates tips from their passengers, which increases the total score.\n\nThis sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem.
