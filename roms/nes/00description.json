The MSX version saw release in Japan by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984.\n\nWhile the Famicom version has a grand total of 99 levels; there is no ending screen implemented in the game.\n\nIn the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously; with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. \"Je te veux\" by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" is played.\n\nA top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray. Cobwebs occupy some of the cells on the playing field; possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This \"free cell\" always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment. In order to make the challenges more difficult; they are unbalanced and offer a different experience for Gurin and Malon.",

Besides just the different title, Akumaj\u014d Densetsu, the Japanese version has several other differences. Most notably, the original Japanese version contained a specialized \"VRC6\" coprocessor chip. Other changes differed in the gameplay or graphics. Instead of using a stabbing dagger, Grant throws daggers as his main attack. Some enemies do less damage in the Japanese version, and had their sprites changed for the Western releases. Some instances of nudity on the enemies were also censored, and religious iconography was pared down. The Japanese version had slightly different backgrounds in many stages, and had special effects not seen in the North American and European releases.\n\nThe year is 1476, and Count Dracula has started to ravage Europe with an army of monsters. The Belmont family of vampire hunters, once exiled from Wallachia, are called into action by the Church. They feared the Belmonts' \"super-human\" power, but with Dracula menacing to swallow Europe in darkness, they are left with no choice but to call Trevor Belmont, current wielder of the Vampire Killer Whip.\n\nJoining Trevor Belmont in his mission to defeat Dracula are three new playable characters: Sypha Belnades, a young sorceress with poor physical attack power but powerful elemental magic spells at her disposal; Grant Danasty, a pirate with the ability to climb on walls and change direction in mid-jump (a rare ability in earlier games of the series); and Alucard, Dracula's son, a dhampir with the ability to shoot fireballs and transform into a bat. Trevor can be accompanied by only one companion at a time. If he chooses to take on another he must abandon his current companion. The player can \"spiritually transform\" between Trevor and his ally with the \"select\" button. Both Trevor and whoever is accompanying him share the same health meter. The ending of the game differs depending on which companion Trevor has with him at the time, or if he does not take another character with him at all. The ending determines the path of the character to Valhalla.",

No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that’s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game’s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again.

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called \"Easy Spin\" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)",
